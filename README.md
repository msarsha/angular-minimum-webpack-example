_A bare minimum Angular setup using webpack 2_

## Why

Wanted to learn and understand how to setup an Angular project using webpack, but every starter or seed out there was too overwhelming and contain a lot of bloat for someone who just started with webpack.

So hopefuly others in the same situation as me could find this example helpful.


### How to use
1. Clone
2. Install - `yarn install` or `npm install` 
3. Build - `yarn build` or `npm run build` - build folder is `dist/`
4. Run - `yarn start` or `npm start` and browse to `http://localhost:8080/` in your favorite browser.
