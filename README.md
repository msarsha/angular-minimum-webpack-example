_A bare minimum Angular setup using webpack 2_

## Why

Wanted to learn and understand how to setup an Angular project using webpack, but every starter or seed out there was too overwhelming and contain a lot of bloat for someone who just started with webpack.

So hopefuly others in the same situation as me could find this example helpful.


### How to use
1. Clone
2. Install - `yarn install`
3. Build - `yarn run build`
4. Run - `yarn start`
